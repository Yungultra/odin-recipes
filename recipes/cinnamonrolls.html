    <p>Fluffy Golden Cinnamon rolls right of of the air fryer are a deliciously sweet treat for you and your family in minutes!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tube cinnamon rolls</li>
        <li>ICING!</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Open the tube package of refrigerated cinnamon rolls and set the icing container aside. Separate the cinnamon rolls and place them into your un-greased air fryer basket or onto your air fryer trays. *If they can be kept from touching, the cinnamon rolls will cook much more quickly!</li>
    <li>Place the basket or tray with cinnamon rolls into your air fryer and cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8-10 minutes with spacing. If the cinnamon rolls are touching, the center takes longer. Mine have taken up to 18 minutes to cook completely.</li>
    <li>Remove the rolls from your air fryer basket or tray and spread the icing on each cinnamon roll. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
